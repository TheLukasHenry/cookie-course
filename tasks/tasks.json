Use the specific baking images for the emptier sections with parallax effects:\n   - baking1.png\n   - baking6.png\n   - baking10.png\n   - Select appropriate high-quality background images for the remaining 2 sections that align with the website's theme and design.\n2. Position content on the opposite side from where the main visual elements appear in each image to create balanced layouts:\n   - Analyze each image to identify the main visual elements\n   - Place text and interactive elements on the opposite side for visual balance\n   - Create a content positioning strategy for each section based on its background image\n3. Optimize all images for web use (compress, proper dimensions, consider WebP format).\n4. Implement the parallax effect using one of these approaches:\n   - Pure CSS approach using `background-attachment: fixed` with appropriate fallbacks\n   - JavaScript-based approach using scroll event listeners and `requestAnimationFrame`\n   - Consider using a lightweight library like Rellax.js if complexity warrants it\n5. CSS implementation example:\n   ```css\n   .parallax-section {\n     height: 100vh;\n     background-image: url('baking1.png');\n     background-attachment: fixed;\n     background-position: center;\n     background-repeat: no-repeat;\n     background-size: cover;\n     transform: translateZ(0);\n     will-change: transform;\n   }\n   \n   .content-right {\n     margin-left: auto;\n     width: 50%;\n     padding: 2rem;\n   }\n   \n   .content-left {\n     width: 50%;\n     padding: 2rem;\n   }\n   ```\n6. JavaScript implementation example:\n   ```javascript\n   const parallaxElements = document.querySelectorAll('.parallax-element');\n   \n   window.addEventListener('scroll', () => {\n     requestAnimationFrame(() => {\n       const scrollY = window.scrollY;\n       parallaxElements.forEach(element => {\n         const speed = element.dataset.speed || 0.5;\n         const yPos = -(scrollY * speed);\n         element.style.transform = `translateY(${yPos}px)`;\n       });\n     });\n   });\n   ```\n7. Implement progressive enhancement to ensure basic functionality on devices that don't support advanced effects.\n8. Add appropriate data attributes to control parallax speed and direction for each section.\n9. Ensure smooth transitions between sections with parallax effects.\n10. Implement throttling or debouncing for scroll events to optimize performance.\n11. Add appropriate CSS for mobile devices, potentially reducing or disabling effects on smaller screens:\n    ```css\n    @media (max-width: 768px) {\n      .parallax-section {\n        background-attachment: scroll;\n      }\n      .content-right, .content-left {\n        width: 100%;\n        margin: 0;\n        padding: 1rem;\n      }\n    }\n    ```",

        "details": "## Implementation Steps:\n\n1. **Prepare the Images**\n   - Ensure baking1.png, baking6.png, and baking10.png are optimized for web (compressed without quality loss)\n   - Place images in the appropriate assets directory (e.g., `/assets/images/`)\n\n2. **Update HTML Structure**\n   - Modify the Hero section to use baking1.png as background\n   - Update the About section to use baking6.png as background\n   - Change the Contact section to use baking10.png as background\n   - For each section, ensure the container has appropriate class/id for parallax implementation\n\n3. **Implement Parallax Effect**\n   - Use the existing parallax implementation or add the following CSS:\n   ```css\n   .parallax-section {\n     background-attachment: fixed;\n     background-position: center;\n     background-repeat: no-repeat;\n     background-size: cover;\n     overflow: hidden;\n   }\n   ```\n   - Add JavaScript for enhanced parallax scrolling if needed:\n   ```javascript\n   window.addEventListener('scroll', function() {\n     const parallaxSections = document.querySelectorAll('.parallax-section');\n     parallaxSections.forEach(section => {\n       const speed = section.dataset.speed || 0.5;\n       const yPos = -(window.pageYOffset * speed);\n       section.style.backgroundPosition = `center ${yPos}px`;\n     });\n   });\n   ```\n\n4. **Balance Content Positioning**\n   - For Hero section (baking1.png): Analyze the image and position text/content on the opposite side from main visual elements\n   - For About section (baking6.png): Position content to create visual balance with the image\n   - For Contact section (baking10.png): Ensure form elements and text are positioned for optimal readability and don't conflict with key image elements\n   - Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for responsive positioning:\n   ```css\n   .content-container {\n     display: flex;\n     justify-content: flex-start; /* or flex-end depending on image */\n     align-items: center;\n     min-height: 70vh;\n   }\n   \n   .content-box {\n     width: 50%;\n     padding: 2rem;\n     background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8); /* semi-transparent background */\n     border-radius: 8px;\n     margin: 0 5%; /* adjust based on image */\n   }\n   ```\n\n5. **Ensure Responsive Behavior**\n   - Add media queries to adjust content positioning on smaller screens\n   - Consider disabling parallax on mobile devices for performance:\n   ```css\n   @media (max-width: 768px) {\n     .parallax-section {\n       background-attachment: scroll;\n     }\n     .content-box {\n       width: 90%;\n       margin: 0 auto;\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n6. **Optimize Performance**\n   - Implement lazy loading for background images\n   - Consider adding preload hints for critical images",
