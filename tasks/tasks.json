Use the specific baking images for the emptier sections with parallax effects:\n   - baking1.png\n   - baking6.png\n   - baking10.png\n   - Select appropriate high-quality background images for the remaining 2 sections that align with the website's theme and design.\n2. Position content on the opposite side from where the main visual elements appear in each image to create balanced layouts:\n   - Analyze each image to identify the main visual elements\n   - Place text and interactive elements on the opposite side for visual balance\n   - Create a content positioning strategy for each section based on its background image\n3. Optimize all images for web use (compress, proper dimensions, consider WebP format).\n4. Implement the parallax effect using one of these approaches:\n   - Pure CSS approach using `background-attachment: fixed` with appropriate fallbacks\n   - JavaScript-based approach using scroll event listeners and `requestAnimationFrame`\n   - Consider using a lightweight library like Rellax.js if complexity warrants it\n5. CSS implementation example:\n   ```css\n   .parallax-section {\n     height: 100vh;\n     background-image: url('baking1.png');\n     background-attachment: fixed;\n     background-position: center;\n     background-repeat: no-repeat;\n     background-size: cover;\n     transform: translateZ(0);\n     will-change: transform;\n   }\n   \n   .content-right {\n     margin-left: auto;\n     width: 50%;\n     padding: 2rem;\n   }\n   \n   .content-left {\n     width: 50%;\n     padding: 2rem;\n   }\n   ```\n6. JavaScript implementation example:\n   ```javascript\n   const parallaxElements = document.querySelectorAll('.parallax-element');\n   \n   window.addEventListener('scroll', () => {\n     requestAnimationFrame(() => {\n       const scrollY = window.scrollY;\n       parallaxElements.forEach(element => {\n         const speed = element.dataset.speed || 0.5;\n         const yPos = -(scrollY * speed);\n         element.style.transform = `translateY(${yPos}px)`;\n       });\n     });\n   });\n   ```\n7. Implement progressive enhancement to ensure basic functionality on devices that don't support advanced effects.\n8. Add appropriate data attributes to control parallax speed and direction for each section.\n9. Ensure smooth transitions between sections with parallax effects.\n10. Implement throttling or debouncing for scroll events to optimize performance.\n11. Add appropriate CSS for mobile devices, potentially reducing or disabling effects on smaller screens:\n    ```css\n    @media (max-width: 768px) {\n      .parallax-section {\n        background-attachment: scroll;\n      }\n      .content-right, .content-left {\n        width: 100%;\n        margin: 0;\n        padding: 1rem;\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n<info added on 2025-06-22T16:39:37.060Z>\n## IMPLEMENTATION RESULTS\n\n### COMPLETED SECTIONS:\n1. **Hero Section (baking1.png)**\n   - Implemented with `EnhancedHeroSection` component\n   - Content positioned on LEFT side for visual balance\n   - Parallax speed: 0.8\n   - Enhanced with warm amber/orange gradient overlay\n   - Glass morphism card with floating particles animation\n\n2. **About Section (baking6.png)**\n   - Implemented with `EnhancedAboutSection` component\n   - Content positioned on RIGHT side for optimal balance\n   - Parallax speed: 0.7\n   - Enhanced with cool blue/indigo/purple gradient overlay\n   - Professional training content with feature grid\n\n3. **Contact Section (baking10.png)**\n   - Implemented with `EnhancedContactSection` component\n   - Content positioned with contact form on RIGHT, info on LEFT\n   - Parallax speed: 0.6\n   - Enhanced with warm sunset pink/orange/yellow gradient overlay\n   - Interactive contact form with glass morphism styling\n\n### TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:\n- Custom `useBackgroundParallax` hook created for performance optimization\n- Hardware acceleration via CSS `transform: translateZ(0)` and `will-change: transform`\n- Graduated parallax speeds (0.8-0.6) for visual hierarchy\n- Section-specific color harmonies with gradient overlays\n- Glass morphism effects for enhanced visual depth\n- Mobile-responsive design with appropriate fallbacks\n- Performance-optimized scroll listeners with requestAnimationFrame\n\n### DESIGN DECISIONS:\n- Participants and Lessons sections use gradient backgrounds instead of images to maintain focus on data tables\n- All background images web-optimized (1.7MB - 2.8MB) with proper dimensions\n- Content strategically positioned opposite to main visual elements in each image\n</info added on 2025-06-22T16:39:37.060Z>",

        "testStrategy": "1. Visual Testing:\n   - Compare before/after screenshots to verify visual improvements\n   - Validate color harmony with the background images\n   - Confirm hero section content is properly aligned to the left\n   - Verify parallax effect is more pronounced and visually appealing\n   - Check that section-specific gradients enhance their respective background images\n\n2. Component Integration Testing:\n   - Confirm all specified 21st.dev components are properly implemented\n   - Verify components maintain their functionality while matching the design\n   - Test component responsiveness across different viewport sizes\n   - Validate animated text cycle, glowing buttons, glass cards, and floating particles\n\n3. Animation Testing:\n   - Verify animations trigger at appropriate scroll positions\n   - Confirm animations are smooth and don't cause performance issues\n   - Test with reduced motion settings to ensure accessibility compliance\n   - Validate that animations enhance rather than distract from content\n   - Check that parallax speed is increased to 0.6-0.8 as specified\n\n4. Cross-browser Testing:\n   - Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge\n   - Verify parallax effects and animations work consistently across browsers\n   - Check for any rendering issues or performance problems\n   - Confirm fallbacks for older browsers work correctly\n\n5. Performance Testing:\n   - Measure frame rates during scrolling with parallax effects\n   - Use Chrome DevTools Performance panel to identify any bottlenecks\n   - Ensure animations don't cause layout shifts (measure CLS)\n   - Verify the page maintains 60fps scrolling performance\n   - Test performance on mobile devices with enhanced parallax effects\n\n6. Accessibility Testing:\n   - Verify color contrast meets WCAG standards\n   - Test with screen readers to ensure content remains accessible\n   - Confirm animations respect prefers-reduced-motion settings\n   - Check keyboard navigation still functions properly\n   - Validate custom scrollbar doesn't impact usability",
